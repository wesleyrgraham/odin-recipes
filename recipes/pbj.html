                <h4>Ingredients and Suggested Materials</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 teaspoon(y'all don't like making these because a butterknife ain't gonna do it. Use a spoon, you don't need it but you have my permission)</li>
                    <li>1 container of peanut butter (for this recipe I use <em>extra crunchy</em>)</li>
                    <li>1 container of Jelly (any flavor, but y'all need to investigate apple jelly)</li>
                    <li>2 pieces of bread(1 will also do in a pinch but you'll have to cut it in half or fold it over) </li>
                    <li>1 paper towel (to use as a plate and to wipe your mouth when you are done)</li>
                </ul>
            <div>
                <h4>Assembly Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lay your 2 pieces of bread on the paper towl</li>
                    <li>Open jelly first and place large scoop of jelly on one slice of bread (It's very important to scoop jelly first, as it doesn't stick to the spoon like the peanut butter)</li>
                    <li>Use the edges and back side of the spoon to distribute the jelly evenly across one side of the bread(Use both hands!)</li>
                    <li>Open peanut butter and place scoop of peanut butter on the unjellied slice of bread(if doing recipe with 1 piece of bread or a tortilla you'll have to get creative)</li>
                    <li>Use spoon to evenly distribute peanut butter</li>
                    <li>Combine the two pieces of bread so that the peanut butter and jelly are touching each other</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h4>Poverty Kitchen <em>NEXT LEVEL</em> Techniques</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a little honey and slices of banana on the peanut butter before assembling</li>
                    <li>Put a glass of milk in the freezer before starting the assembly instructions. It will be slightly cooler by the time you're done and makes the sandwhich oh so good</li>
                    <li>Lay on top of toaster to heat sandwhich. Be sure to rotate and flip regularly to avoid burning and possible fire hazard</li>
                </ul>
